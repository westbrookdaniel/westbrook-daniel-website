Nextjs just got it's most recent update - 10.1 - which brings a lot of new exciting features. Some highlights include:

-   3x faster refresh
-   Reduced install time/size
-   `next/image` Improvements
-   Custom 500 page
-   Initial Webpack 5 support

I want go deeper into into the changes to `next/image` because I think they
do an awesome job at improving the development experience of them.

## What is `next/image`?

"drop-in replacement" but width and height is required
Automatic Image Optimization
working with vercel - now can use custom loaders
automatically serves different images optimised to screen size and format

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image src="/profile-picture.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Profile Picture">
```

## Now in built in WebAssembly

used to use a native dependency.
native dependencies consuming 50% of Next.js' total install size

now with WebAssembly.  
reduced install size by ~30MB and added support for Apple Silicon M1 MacBooks
now works in next dev and next start

still improving with SIMD extensions and multi-threading.

## Did I mention development is faster?

previous development struggles

3x Faster Refresh
You can get even faster with future webpack5
and even faster again with future strictPostcssConfiguration

Theres lots more in this update that you should check out

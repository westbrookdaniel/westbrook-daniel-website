Why doesn't this work?

```javascript
function getLogger(arg) {
    function logger() {
        console.log(arg)
    }
    return logger
}

let fruit = 'raspberry'
const logFruit = getLogger(fruit)

logFruit() // "raspberry"
fruit = 'peach'
logFruit() // "raspberry" Wait what!? Why is this not "peach"?
```

So, to talk through what's happening here, I'm creating a variable called
`fruit` and assigning it to a string `'raspberry'`, then I pass `fruit` to a
function which creates and returns a function called `logger` which should log
the `fruit` when called. When I call that function, I get a `console.log` output
of `'raspberry'` as expected.

But then I reassign `fruit` to `'peach'` and call the `logger` again. But
instead of getting a `console.log` of the new value of `fruit`, I get the old
value of `fruit`!

I can side-step this by calling `getLogger` again to get a new logger:

```javascript
const logFruit2 = getLogger(fruit)
logFruit2() // "peach" what a relief...
```

But why can't I just change the value of the variable and get the `logger` to
log the latest value?

The answer is closures. Let me briefly describe what's going on here:

```javascript
function getLogger(arg) {
    function logger() {
        console.log(arg)
    }
    return logger
}

// side-note, this could be written like this too
// and it wouldn't make any difference whatsoever:
// const getLogger = arg => () => console.log(arg)
// I just decided to go more verbose to keep it simple
```

When `getLogger` is called, the `logger` function is created. It's a brand new
function. When a brand new function is created, it looks around for all the
variables it has access to and "closes over" them to form what's called a
"closure". This means that so long as this `logger` function exists, it will
have access to the variables in its parent's function and other module-level
variables.

So what variables does `logger` have access to when it's created? Looking at the
example again, it'll have access to `fruit`, `getLogger`, `arg`, and `logger`
(itself). Read that list again, because it's critical to why the code works the
way it does. Did you notice something? Both `fruit` and `arg` are listed, even
though they're the exact same value!

Just because two variables are assigned the same value doesn't mean they are the
same variable. Here's a simplified example of that concept:

```javascript
let a = 1
let b = a

console.log(a, b) // 1, 1

a = 2
console.log(a, b) // 2, 1 ‚ÄºÔ∏è
```

Notice that even though we assigned `b` to `a`, we were able to change the
assignment to `a` and the value `b` was assigned to is unchanged. This is
because we didn't assign `b` to `a` per se. We assigned `b` to the value `a` was
assigned to at the time!

I like to think of variables as little arrows that point to places in the
computer's memory. So when we say `let a = 1`, we're saying: "Hey JavaScript
engine, I want you to create a place in memory with the value of `1` and then
create an arrow (variable) called `a` that points to that place in memory."

Then when we say: `let b = a`, we're saying "Hey JavaScript engine, I want you
to create an arrow (variable) called `b` that points to the same place that `a`
points to at the moment."

In the same way, when you call a function, the JavaScript engine creates a new
variable for the function arguments. In our case, we called `getLogger(fruit)`
and the JavaScript engine basically did this:

```javascript
let arg = fruit
```

So then, when we later do `fruit = 'peach'`, it has no impact on `arg` because
they're completely different variables.

Whether you think of this as a limitation or a feature, the fact is that this is
the way it works. If you want to keep two variables up-to-date with each other,
there is a way to do that! Well, sorta. The idea is this: instead of changing
where the arrows (variables) point, you can change what they're pointing to! For
example:

```javascript
let a = { current: 1 }
let b = a

console.log(a.current, b.current) // 1, 1

a.current = 2
console.log(a.current, b.current) // 2, 2 üéâ
```

In this case, we're not reassigning a, but rather changing the value that `a` is
pointing to. And because `b` happens to be pointed at the same thing, they both
get the update.

So, let's apply this solution to our `logger` problem:

```javascript
function getLatestLogger(argRef) {
    function logger() {
        console.log(argRef.current)
    }
    return logger
}

const fruitRef = { current: 'raspberry' }

const latestLogger = getLatestLogger(fruitRef)

latestLogger() // "raspberry"
fruitRef.current = 'peach'
latestLogger() // "peach" üéâ
```

The `Ref` suffix is short for "reference" which is to say that the value the
variable points to is simply used to reference another value (which in our case
is the `current` property of an object).

## Conclusion

Closures are an awesome feature of JavaScript and so much of what we can do with
JavaScript is a result of the way its closures work. I hope this helped you get
an idea of the power, limitations, and workarounds of closures. They're
critically important for React (learn more in

Hope that helps! Good luck!

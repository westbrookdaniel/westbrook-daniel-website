With the release of Nextjs 11, I decided it was time for some website improvements.
Some of the key problems I wanted to solve was:

-   Initial image loading
-   Better development linting
-   Dark mode (very exciting)

## Nextjs to the Rescue

Thankfully, these first two are made easy by Nextjs 11. The recent `placeholder` property
added to the `next/image` component allows for the easy generating of blur effects on the
initial load of images. Check out more about the feature in their [blog post](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#image-placeholders).

Nextjs also added ESLint support with great defaults and performance-related linting.
It's easy to get started by running `npx next lint` which configures ESLint and lets you know
what you need to fix. This is included as a part of [Conformance for Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-11#conformance)
which looks like a great direction for the future of the framework.

## Theming!

I originally wanted to just achieve a dark mode option for my website, but I decided
I wanted to make more colour schemes avalible whilst still having an automatic colour switcher.
My inspiration originally came from the [Rebass website](https://rebassjs.org/) pictured below which
has a similar colour scheme switcher.

The styling of my website is done with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and since it supports using CSS custom properties, that
was where I started my implementation.

I used the strategy of creating a ThemeHandler to consume a theme from local storage, and a piece of global state
provided by [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand).

```tsx
export const useTheme = create<ThemeStore>((set, get) => ({
    theme:
        getLocalStorage('theme') ||
        (typeof window !== 'undefined'
            ? window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches
                ? 'dark'
                : 'light'
            : 'light'),
    updateTheme: theme => {
        setLocalStorage('theme', theme)
        set({ theme })
    },
    rotateTheme: () =>
        set(s => {
            const keys = Object.keys(themes)
            const i = keys.indexOf(s.theme)
            const newTheme = (keys.length - 1 > i
                ? keys[i + 1]
                : keys[0]) as keyof typeof themes
            setLocalStorage('theme', newTheme)
            return { theme: newTheme }
        }),
}))
```

Because this is outside of a component and Nextjs code is run on the server, I do need to make sure that
the window exists before checking if dark mode is active using `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches`. Next, I
needed to attach some CSS variables to the root of the document for the initial load of the website,
and a set of themes to consume later.

```css
:root {
    --brand: #d43c29;
    --on-brand: #ffffff;

    --accent: #6f5623;
    --accent-hover: #846929;
    --accent-focus: #9a7c2e;
    --on-accent: #ffffff;

    --background: #ffffff;
    --on-background: #4d5c63;
    --heading-on-background: #000;

    /* ... */
}
```

```tsx
export const themes = {
    light: {
        brand: '#d43c29',
        /* ... */
    },
    dark: {
        brand: '#e36552',
        /* ... */
    },
}
```

Now we get to the fun stuff - actually changing the colour scheme. This is done in a `useEffect` hook
so we can only change the theme only when we need to. By attaching an event listener for `change`
to `window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')` we can update the theme automatically if the user
turns on their computers dark mode.

We can then use our theme object to get the set of colours we need to apply and utilise `` /*...*/ style.setProperty(`--${key}`, value) ``
to update the colour scheme. You can find below some more of the code I used for changing and handling the theme.

```tsx
const theme = useTheme(s => s.theme)
const updateTheme = useTheme(s => s.updateTheme)

/* ... */

useEffect(() => {
    if (!document.documentElement) return

    window
        .matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')
        .addEventListener('change', e => {
            if (e.matches) {
                updateTheme('dark')
            } else {
                updateTheme('light')
            }
        })

    const currentTheme = themes[theme]

    Object.keys(currentTheme).forEach(key => {
        const value = currentTheme[key as keyof typeof currentTheme]
        document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--${key}`, value)
    })
}, [theme, updateTheme])
```

## The Future

It was a lot of fun doing this performance refresh. Keep your eye out
for more themes coming in the future. Some features I may look at adding next
along these lines are a theme picker for code blocks and more development tooling to
help create more performant images.

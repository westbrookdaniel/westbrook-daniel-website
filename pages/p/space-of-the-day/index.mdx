The purpose of this website is to attract a younger audience to NASAâ€™s Astronomy
Picture of the Day by providing a better experience with a more appealing design.
This is solved in my solution by having the entire months images easily accessible
and searchable. I kept the feeling of intrigue/FOMO intact through the use of a
dramatic hero section and by only showing the last month worth of images.

	side="left" 
	slot={(
		<Image small src={single} alt="Single" />
	)}

## Development

Website is built as a single page app using React Router with dynamic
loading of content on the client. Data is cached as you navigate, with
the ability to search the month images by name, date, and author, and
download them easily.

## Branding

The design aims to emphasize the core visual ideas of analytical, knowledgeable,
charismatic, user friendly, and astronomy. From there I developed an aesthetic
vision based on something that is engaging and visually interesting. My visual
concept is a magazine cover which uses expressive, colourful type laid over
images with a steadfast and considered charisma. The name is a play on its source,
but with a low attention-span and visual focus. The logo typeface is Playfair
Display with both the body and heading font being Epilogue and the contrast
between both typefaces helps to create the feeling of a visually striking cover.

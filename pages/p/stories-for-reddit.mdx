## Branding

The color pallet and general aesthetic is a minimalist and modernized version
of old library pages. This helps create a warm and comforting feeling, which
along with the serif heading typefaces encourages a relaxing reading experience.
The body typeface was chosen to be very legible and easy to read, whilst the
images harmonies with the library style color pallet. The brandmark symbolizes
a blocked out paragraph of text, showing how easily stories can be consumed
in a simple and time effective way.

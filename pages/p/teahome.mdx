## Development

The app features a MongoDB database accessed through JSON data from the Express
server, which statically serves the single page app. It utilizes hash based
routing, and uses the template engine Mustache for simple insertion of data
into layouts. The app has dynamic collection routes, product modals, and car
system. Products and collections can also be altered using the built in admin
account which has full CRUD functionality.

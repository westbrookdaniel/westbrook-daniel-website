## Development

The app features a MongoDB database accessed through JSON data from the
Express server, which statically serves the single page app. It utilizes
hash-based routing and uses the template engine Mustache for simple insertion
of data into layouts. The app has dynamic collection routes, product modals,
and an account system. Products and collections can also be altered using
the built-in admin account and interface which has full create, read,
update, and delete functionality.

To attract a younger audience to NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day. Currently
their website not only looks outdated, but lacks a showcase previous days pictures
and discoverability. This is solved in my solution by having the entire months
images easily accessible and searchable. I kept the feeling of intrigue/FOMO
intact through the use of a dramatic hero section and by only showing the last
month worth of images.

## Details

Website is built as a single page app using React Router with dynamic 
loading of content on the client. Data is cached as you navigate, with 
the ability to search the month images by name, date, and author, and 
download them easily.

## Branding

The design aims to emphasize the core visual ideas of analytical, 
knowledgeable, charismatic, user friendly, and astronomy. From 
there I developed an aesthetic vision based on something that is 
engaging and visually interesting. My visual concept is a magazine 
cover which uses expressive, colorful type laid over images with a 
steadfast and considered charisma. The name is a play on its source, 
although using a quick attention seeking focus on space. The logo 
typeface is Playfair Display with both the body and heading font 
being Epilogue and the contrast between both typefaces helps to 
create the feeling of a visual striking cover.

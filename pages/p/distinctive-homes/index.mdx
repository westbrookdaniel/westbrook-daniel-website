Built to develop an engaging and on-brand website to help attract new customers
and showcase Distinctive Homes WAâ€™s Projects. I was tasked to create a website
for their established business that appealed to their audience whilst feeling
refined, luxurious, independent and personable.

Developed while working for <a href="https://eclipsedesigns.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse Design Solutions</a>

## Development

The website was created with marketing, SEO, and web best practices

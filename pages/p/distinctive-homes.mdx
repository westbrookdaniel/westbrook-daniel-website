Built to develop an engaging and on brand website to help attract new customers
and showcase Distinctive Homes WAâ€™s Projects. As an established business,
I was tasked to create a website that appealed to their audience whilst
feeling refined, luxurious, independent and personable.

Developed while working for <a href="https://eclipsedesigns.com.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipse Design Solutions</a>

## Development

The website was built with marketing, SEO, and web best practices in mind.
It was built with Wordpress to give the client a superior maintenance
experience that allows them to easily update content and add projects
in the future.

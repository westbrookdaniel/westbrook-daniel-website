fully-featured account system, along with posts gathered and

## Branding

The colour pallet and general aesthetic is a minimalist and modernized
version of old library pages. This helps create a warm and comforting
feeling, which along with the serif heading typefaces encourages a relaxing
reading experience. The body typeface was chosen to be very legible and
easy to read, whilst the images harmonies with the library-style colour
pallet. The brandmark symbolizes a blocked out paragraph of text,
showing how easily stories can be consumed in a simple and time-effective way.
